# Upgrading to v0.13

## Bump Your Deps

Update Backpex to the latest version:

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:backpex, "~> 0.13.0"}
    ]
  end
```

## Modified components

The following components have been modified:

- `Backpex.HTML.Layout.modal/1`

If you use any of these in your project codebase, make sure they work as expected. You may need to change some
attributes (see the component documentation).
