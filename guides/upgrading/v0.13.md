# Upgrading to v0.13

## Bump Your Deps

Update Backpex to the latest version:

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:backpex, "~> 0.13.0"}
    ]
  end
```

## Removed assigns

We have removed a lot of socket assigns from `LiveResource`s. If you depend on them, you can get them via the
`@live_resource` assign which contains the module name of your `LiveResource`.

Before:

```
@schema
@repo
@singular_name
@plural_name
@full_text_search
```

After:

```
@live_resource.config(:adapter_config)[:schema]
@live_resource.config(:adapter_config)[:repo]
@live_resource.singular_name()
@live_resource.plural_name()
@live_resource.config(:full_text_search)
```

## Modified components

The following components have been modified:

- `Backpex.HTML.Layout.modal/1`

If you use any of these in your project codebase, make sure they work as expected. You may need to change some
attributes (see the component documentation).
