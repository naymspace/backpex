# Upgrading to v0.16

## Bump Your Deps

Update Backpex to the latest version:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:backpex, "~> 0.16.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Refactoring of filter components

We have enhanced and refactored the filter components, introducing some breaking changes.

- `index_` prefix from filter component names has been removed
- `filter_badge/1` component has been moved to `Backpex.HTML.Resource`

Note that you will only be affected by these changes if you use filter components manually on custom pages.

Due to the refactoring of the filter components, there may be other unexpected errors, so we recommend looking into
[the changes of the PR](https://github.com/naymspace/backpex/pull/1553) in detail if you manually insert filter components to pages.
