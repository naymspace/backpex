# Upgrading to v0.16

## Bump Your Deps

Update Backpex to the latest version:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:backpex, "~> 0.16.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Component changes

- `Backpex.HTML.Layout.field_container/1` now uses a `dl` element instead of a `div` element to better align with HTML semantics
- `Backpex.HTML.Layout.input_label/1` has been enhanced by adding `as`, `for` and `rest` attribute
