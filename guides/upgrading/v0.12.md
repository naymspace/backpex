# Upgrading to v0.12

## Bump Your Deps

Update Backpex to the latest version:

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:backpex, "~> 0.12.0"}
    ]
  end
```

## PubSub config is now optional

You can safely remove the pubsub configuration from your LiveResources:

```elixir
    pubsub: [
        name: Demo.PubSub
        topic: "posts",
        event_prefix: "post_"
    ]
```

In order to make it work, you need to set your PubSub server in your config:

```elixir
config :backpex, :pubsub_server, MyApp.PubSub
```

In case you still want to overwrite the settings, the `name` option is now called `server`.

The option for `event_prefix` was removed. Broadcasted events are just called `created`, `updated` and `deleted` now.

See [Listen to PubSub Events](live_resource/listen-to-pubsub-events.md) for more info.

## `return_to/4` becomes `return_to/5`

We have added a `form_action` parameter to the `return_to` function.
This allows you to customize the URL based on whether the user cancels or saves an item.

If you previously had something like this in your LiveResource:

```elixir
@impl Backpex.LiveResource
def return_to(socket, assigns, _live_action, _item) do
  ~p"/admin/posts"
end
```

change it to:

```elixir
@impl Backpex.LiveResource
def return_to(socket, assigns, _live_action, _form_action, _item) do
  ~p"/admin/posts"
end
```
