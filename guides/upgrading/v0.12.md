# Upgrading to v0.12

## Bump Your Deps

Update Backpex to the latest version:

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:backpex, "~> 0.12.0"}
    ]
  end
```

## PubSub config is now optional

You can safely remove the pubsub configuration from your LiveResources:

```elixir
    pubsub: [
        name: Demo.PubSub
        topic: "posts",
        event_prefix: "post_"
    ]
```

In order to make it work, you need to set your PubSub server in your config:

```elixir
config :backpex, :pubsub_server, MyApp.PubSub
```

In case you still want to overwrite the settings, the `name` option is now called `server`.

The option for `event_prefix` was removed. Broadcasted events are just called `created`, `updated` and `deleted` now.

See [Listen to PubSub Events](live_resource/listen-to-pubsub-events.md) for more info.

## "Save & Continue editing" button is disabled by default

The "Save & Continue editing" button is now disabled by default. Use the `save_and_continue_editing?` option in your 
LiveResource to enable it.

```elixir
use Backpex.LiveResource,
  ...,
  save_and_continue_button?: true
```
